ai_response: Subject: Project Update: WhatsApp Integration â€“ Revised Timeline

Dear [Stakeholders' Names],

I hope this message finds you well.

I am writing to inform you of a two-week delay in the WhatsApp integration project. We sincerely apologize for this shift in the timeline and understand the importance of timely delivery for your planning and operations.

The delay is due to a set of unforeseen technical challenges encountered during the integration phase. Specifically, we faced compatibility issues with the messaging API and encountered unexpected behavior in the authentication flow, which required additional development and testing to ensure a secure and seamless user experience.

We are actively addressing these issues and have already made significant progress. Based on the current status, we have revised the project timeline as follows:

Revised Completion Date: [New Date, e.g., 29 July 2025]
Next Milestone: Final testing and QA to begin on [Date, e.g., 22 July 2025]
Next Steps:

Our development team will complete the remaining integration work by [New Target Date].
We will conduct a full round of testing to ensure stability and performance.
A follow-up update will be shared by [Midpoint Date] to confirm progress and readiness for deployment.
We remain fully committed to delivering a high-quality solution and appreciate your patience and continued support. Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to schedule a check-in.

Warm regards,
